One morning I woke up
goodbye my Beautiful goodbye my Beautiful goodbye my Beautiful goodbye
one morning I woke up
and I found the invader

Oh partisan take me away
goodbye my Beautiful goodbye my Beautiful goodbye my Beautiful goodbye
oh partisan take me away
that Im feeling like dying

And if I die as a partisan
goodbye my Beautiful goodbye my Beautiful goodbye my Beautiful goodbye
and if I die as a partisan
you must bury me

You will bury me over there on the mountain
goodbye my Beautiful goodbye my Beautiful goodbye my Beautiful goodbye
you will bury me over there on the mountain
under the shadow of a wonderful flower

And all the people passing by
goodbye my Beautiful goodbye my Beautiful goodbye my Beautiful goodbye
and all the people passing by
will say what a wonderful flower

And this is the flower of the partisan
goodbye my Beautiful goodbye my Beautiful goodbye my Beautiful goodbye
dead for our freedom
and this is the flower of the partisan
dead for our freedom
